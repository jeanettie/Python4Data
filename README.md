# Python4Data

Working on a notebook for my CodeLouisville class. Expressing the frequency of injection wells in Oklahoma 
and it's realtion to earthquakes.

The Data: 

I found this dataset on Kaggle. The first set is from the Oklahoma Corporation Commission and holds all the "active" saltwater 
injection wells in Oklahoma and is current as of September 2017. The information ploted is the yearly count of approved new active saltwater injection wells from the begging of the dataset 1936. So the sum of each year's plotted count is all the acitve saltwater injection wells. 

The second set is from the Untied states Geological Society and lists all seismic activity in the  Oklahoma region since 1977 ending in September 2016. It does include seismic activity from the surrounding states. I took only Oklahoma Earthquakes from this data however 
I chose to use all magnitudes not just a set magnitude and up. Since the seismic dataset wasn't complete for 2016 I did include 2016 in
the visualization but want to note that the data ended in September of 2016 so it is not complete. I ended the x axis at 2016 since it
was the last year of complete data for the active injection Well dataset.
